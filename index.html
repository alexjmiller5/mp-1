            <h2>Welcome to the homepage</h2>
            <p>Hi! I am Alex Miller, and I am currently a senior at Boston University in the College of Arts & Sciences in the accelerated BA/MA program studying computer science with a minor in Spanish. 

                At BU, I give tours of the university as an admissions ambassador, help teach computer science concepts to my peers as a course assistant for the computer science department and am an active member of the Massachusetts Beta Alpha chapter of Î£AE, having previously served as Head of Recruitment, Eminent Recorder, Community Service chairman, and Alumni Relations chairman. Last semester, I had the opportunity to live and study in Madrid through BU's Spain Madrid Internship program, where I am immersed myself in Spanish culture, practiced my Spanish language skills, and completed my minor.
                
                Outside of BU, I like to run, spend time with friends, and improve my coding skills via personal projects and professional experience. I spent the previous summer working as a Full Stack Software Engineering Intern for Fidelity Investments and was able to hone my academic computer science knowledge into valuable professional skills.
                
                This year, I look forward to completing my degree and making the most of my final year at BU.</p>
